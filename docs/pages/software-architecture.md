## MBSE - Model Based Systems Engineering
- model based systems engineering
- formalized system of modeling to support systems design
- 'transformational enabler' that undelies the discipline of systems engineering
- a model is a graphical, mathematical, or physical representation of a concept or a construct that can be reasoned about

## What is Software Architecture?
- business goals lead to quality attribute requirements

## Architecture Is a Set of Software Structures
A structure is a set of elements held together by a relation.
Software systems are composed of many structures and no single structure can lay claim to being _the_ architecture.
Structures can be grouped into categories:
1. Component-and-connector structures
2. Module structures
3. Allocation structures

Not all structures are architectural.
A structure is architectural if it supports the reasoning about the system and the system's properties.
The reasoning should be about an attribute of the system that is important to some stakeholder(s).
