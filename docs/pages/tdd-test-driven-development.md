## Definition
- TDD takes the inside-out approach, usually starting with tests of domain objects, then reusing these newly created domain objects
in tests of adjascent layers of code.
- TDD is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

## Mocks / Mocking
- Mocking supplies as-yet-unwritten objects for testing.
- In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behaviour of real objects in controlled ways, most often as part of a software testing initiative. A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behaviour of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a human in vehicle impacts. The technique is also applicable in generic programming. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object)
