# DI - Dependency Injection

- loosley coupled / tightly coupled code
- DI is a set of software design principles and patterns that enables you to develop loosely coupled code.
- Collaborating classes should rely on infrastructure to provide necessary services.
- In DI terminology, we often talk about services and components. A service is typically an Abstraction, a definition for something that provides a service. An implementation of an abstraction is often called a _component_, a class that contains behavior. Because both _service_ and _component_ are such overloaded terms, you will typically see the term "Abstraction" and "class" instead.
- The basic purpose of DI is _maintainability_.
