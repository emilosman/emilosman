# Functional / Non-functional Requirements in Software Architecture
- see: [Software Architecture](/pages/software-architecture.md)

Software architecture has very little to do with functional requirements.
You can implement a set of use cases — an application’s functional requirements — with any architecture.
In fact, it’s common for successful applications, to be big balls of mud.

Architecture matters, however, because of how it affects the so-called quality of service requirements, also called nonfunctional requirements, quality attributes, or ilities.

## Functional Requirements
- A set of use cases: what the application does.

## Non-functional Requirements
- quality of service requirements
- quality attributes
- ilities:
  - Noun. ility (plural ilities) (software engineering) An abstract quality that good software should exhibit.
  - "One reason to use software libraries is that the authors have had time to add ilities in addition to the basic functionality"
  - maintainability, extensibility, and testability.

## CFR: Cross-functional requirements
The Cross-functional requirements(CFRs) of a product define the systems operational attributes like performance, availability, reliability, usability, accessibility, audit, logging, recoverability, user volume, security, localisation, etc.
