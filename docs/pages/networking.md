## Internet's 5 layers
- application
- transport
- network
- link
- physical

## Terminology
- hosts + end systems
- end systems are connected via communication links + packet switches
- communication links transmit data at different rates
- transmission rates are measured in bits/second
- packets: when sending data from one end system to another, the transmitter sends packets
- packet: header + segment of data
- packet switch: takes packet of data and transmits it
- packet switches: routers, link-layer switches
- link-layer switch: used to access network
- router: used in network core
- route or path:  sequence of links a packet travels through a network
- end systems access the internet through ISPs (Internet Service Providers)
- protocols: the internet runs on protocols that control the sending and receiving of data
- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
- IP: Internet Protocol
- IP specifies the format of the packets sent and received between end systems
- these principal protocols are known together as TCP/IP
- IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force): enforces internet standards
- IETF standards documents are called RFCs (Requests for Comment)
- RFCs define standards like: IP, TCP, HTTP, SMTP...
- over 7000 RFCs exist (2017) !
- other bodies standardize network components: IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee
- IEEE 802 2016 standardizes WIFI and Ethernet

## Protocol
A protocol defines the format and order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the action taken upon receipt or transmission of messages and events.
